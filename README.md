## The workshop consists of Modules and Labs
Each Module captures an entire section of our platform, and each Lab, has a specific goal to help you progress in the Workshop.
Labs can be related to each other, they can be a separation of a large collection of steps, or they can be siloed goals for you to achieve.

To get started, please proceed to [The Workshop](https://github.com/signalfx/app-dev-workshop/wiki)
