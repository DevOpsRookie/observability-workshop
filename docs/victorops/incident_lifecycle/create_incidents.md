# Create Incidents

## 1. On-Call

Before generating any incidents you should assign yourself to the current Shift within your **Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours** Rotation and also place yourself **On-Call**.

* Click on the **Schedule** link within your **Team** in the **People** section on the left
* Or navigate to **Teams → [Your Team] → Rotations**
* Expand the **Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours** Rotation
* Click on the **Manage members** icon (the figures) for the current active shift depending on your timezone
![Manage Members](../../images/victorops/manage-members.png){: .zoom}
* Use the **Select a user to add...** dropdown to add yourself to the shift
* Then click on **Set Current** to make yourself the current **on-call** user within the shift
* You should now get a **Push Notification** to your phone informing you that **You Are Now On-Call**

This will result in an Alert being generated by SignalFx which in turn will generate an Incident within VictorOps within a maximum of 10 seconds.

This is the default polling time for the SignalFx Agent we installed (it can be reduced to 1 second if required).
