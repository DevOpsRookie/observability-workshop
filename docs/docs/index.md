## Act in Real-Time with High-Resolution Metrics

* High-resolution metrics drive real-time dashboards, alerts, and insights so you can act before infrastructure performance affects end-user experience

* Build interactive dashboards with up to one-second resolution to get real-time status of infrastructure

* Create prescriptive alerts on hosts metrics or on the performance metrics of an entire cluster

* Quickly troubleshoot a performance bottleneck and drive down MTTR

* Scale with Confidence

* Modernize your applications and adopt cloud-native infrastructure with confidence. SignalFx is built from the ground up to support hyper-scale requirements of containers, microservices, and serverless architectures

* Analyze performance across 100,000s of dynamic and ephemeral components, multiple deployment environments, application versions, billions of events

* Embrace infrastructure immutability. Deploy infrastructure and monitoring-as-code. Instantly start monitoring high-churn, ephemeral infrastructure components

* Drive closed-loop automation such as auto-scaling cloud environments to ensure a flawless end-user experience

## Continually Improve with High-Cardinality Analytics

* Leverage unique insights powered by high-cardinality analytics to optimize infrastructure, application performance and business outcomes

* Dig deep and examine every detail using granular analytics across tens of thousands of dimensions on metric time series

* Aggregate thousands of time series to get the high-fidelity view of the entire infrastructure stack using built-in aggregate functions

* Unlock the value of data science by leveraging SignalFlow Analytics, a data-flow-oriented programming language syntactically similar to python, to express complex data computations with a large library of built-in functions
