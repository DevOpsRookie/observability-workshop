## Enabling µAPM
_An organisation needs to be pre-provisioned as a µAPM entitlement is required for the purposes of this module. Please contact someone from SignalFx to get a trial instance with µAPM enabled if you don’t have one already._

_To check if you have an organisation with µAPM enabled, just login to SignalFx and check that you have the µAPM tab on the top navbar next to Dashboards._

### 1. Create an instance running Kubernetes
This is already documented in [Deploying the Smart Agent in Kubernetes (K3s)](https://signalfx.github.io/app-dev-workshop/module3/k3s/).  

---

### 2. Deploy the Hotrod application into K3s
To deploy the Hotrod application into K3s apply the deployment
  
=== "Input"
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f workshop/apm/hotrod/k8s/deployment.yaml 
    ```
=== "Output"
    ```text
    deployment.apps/hotrod created
    service/hotrod created
    ```

To ensure the Hotrod application is running:

=== "Input"
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```
=== "Output"
    ```text
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    signalfx-agent-mmzxk      1/1     Running   0          110s
    hotrod-7cc9fc85b7-n765r   1/1     Running   0          41s
    ```

You then need find the IP address assigned to the Hotrod service:

=== "Input"
    ```bash
    kubectl get svc
    ```
=== "Output"
    ```text
    NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
    kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    25m
    hotrod       ClusterIP   10.43.124.159   <none>        8080/TCP   94s
    ```

Make note of the `CLUSTER-IP` address associated with Hotrod

---

### 3. Generate some traffic to the application using Apache Benchmark
```bash
ab -n10 -c10 "http://{CLUSTER-IP}:8080/dispatch?customer=392&nonse=0.17041229755366172"
```

Create some errors with an invalid customer number

```bash
ab -n10 -c10 "http://{CLUSTER-IP}:8080/dispatch?customer=391&nonse=0.17041229755366172"
```
