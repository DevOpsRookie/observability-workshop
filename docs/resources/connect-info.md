## 2. Connect to your instance using ssh

Most attendees should be able to connect to the workshop by using ssh as this is a commonly used tool to connect to cloud instances. To do this open a command prompt on your system and type ssh ubuntu@x.x.x.x  (where you replace x.x.x.x with the Ip address  found in step 1. In this case ssh ubuntu@34.247.71.187 )



## 3. Connect to your instance using putty

## 4. Connect to your instance using a browser
