With SignalFx\u2019s patented SignalFlow streaming analytics technology, users get real-time visibility and analytics-driven alerting. SignalFx is the only infrastructure monitoring solution that can detect and alert on meaningful conditions within seconds \u2013 and let you automatically remediate issues before customers are ever affected. Act in Real-Time with High-Resolution Metrics High-resolution metrics drive real-time dashboards, alerts, and insights so you can act before infrastructure performance affects end-user experience Build interactive dashboards with up to one-second resolution to get real-time status of infrastructure Create prescriptive alerts on hosts metrics or on the performance metrics of an entire cluster Quickly troubleshoot a performance bottleneck and drive down MTTR Scale with Confidence Modernize your applications and adopt cloud-native infrastructure with confidence. SignalFx is built from the ground up to support hyper-scale requirements of containers, microservices, and serverless architectures Analyze performance across 100,000s of dynamic and ephemeral components, multiple deployment environments, application versions, billions of events Embrace infrastructure immutability. Deploy infrastructure and monitoring-as-code. Instantly start monitoring high-churn, ephemeral infrastructure components Drive closed-loop automation such as auto-scaling cloud environments to ensure a flawless end-user experience Continually Improve with High-Cardinality Analytics Leverage unique insights powered by high-cardinality analytics to optimize infrastructure, application performance and business outcomes Dig deep and examine every detail using granular analytics across tens of thousands of dimensions on metric time series Aggregate thousands of time series to get the high-fidelity view of the entire infrastructure stack using built-in aggregate functions Unlock the value of data science by leveraging SignalFlow Analytics, a data-flow-oriented programming language syntactically similar to python, to express complex data computations with a large library of built-in functions Let's get started!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#act-in-real-time-with-high-resolution-metrics","text":"High-resolution metrics drive real-time dashboards, alerts, and insights so you can act before infrastructure performance affects end-user experience Build interactive dashboards with up to one-second resolution to get real-time status of infrastructure Create prescriptive alerts on hosts metrics or on the performance metrics of an entire cluster Quickly troubleshoot a performance bottleneck and drive down MTTR Scale with Confidence Modernize your applications and adopt cloud-native infrastructure with confidence.
