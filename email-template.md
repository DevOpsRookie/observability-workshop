# Subject: Splunk DevOps Workshop - 11th July 2020

Hi,

Thank you for registering for the Splunk DevOps Workshop. In order to ensure a smooth and enjoyable workshop there are a few prerequisites that need to be completed beforehand.

The workshop relies on using Virtual Machines (VM) for deployment the SignalFx Smart Agent, running Kubernetes and deploying an instrumented microservice application.

In order to run these VMs, you will need to download and install Multipass [https://multipass.run](https://mutlipass.run). Multipass is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Once installed, please create a VM to ensure all is working correctly.

```bash
multipass launch --name ubuntu
```

However, some people might not be able to install/run Multipass so AWS/EC2 instances will be made available upon request at the beginning of the Workshop
